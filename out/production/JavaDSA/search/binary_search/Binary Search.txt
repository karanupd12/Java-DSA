The Binary search method is only suitable for searching in a sorted array. In this method, the element that has to be searched
is compared to the array's middle element. Search is considered successful only if it matches the target. The binary search
algorithm uses the divide-and-conquer approach, it does not scan every element in the list, it only searches half of the list
instead of going through each element, Hence said to be the best searching algorithm because it is faster to execute as compared
to Linear search.

algorithm :
1) find the middle element i.e; mid=(starting index(s) + (e)ending index)/2
2) target > mid --- search in the right side or else in left(by following the steps 1 again)
3) if mid==target element (that would be our answer)
4) if s>e : target not found

example:
arr=[10,20,30,40,50,60,70] , search for 60.
1) mid =(s+e)/2=(0+6)/2=3rd (middle element is at 3rd index i.e; 40)
2) now 40(mid)<60(target), so check at right
3) arrright=[50,60,70], again mid=((4+7)/2)=5th index i.e;60
4) now target=mid=60, therefore 60 found at 5th index.
